# RAG Implementation with Llama 2, Hugging Face, Langchain, and ChromaDB

This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation using Llama 2 as the primary language model, along with other Hugging Face models, Langchain for orchestration, and ChromaDB for vector storage.  The notebook `rag-using-llama-2-langchain-and-chromadb.ipynb` provides a complete, runnable example of this RAG pipeline.

## Overview

The core idea behind RAG is to combine the strengths of pre-trained language models with the ability to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base. This allows the model to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses, especially when dealing with specialized or up-to-date information that the base model might not have been trained on.

This implementation performs the following steps:

1.  **Installs necessary libraries**: Uses `pip` to install `transformers`, `accelerate`, `einops`, `langchain`, `xformers`, `bitsandbytes`, `sentence_transformers`, `chromadb` and `pysqlite3-binary`.
2.  **Imports necessary modules**: Imports modules from the installed libraries, such as `chromadb`, `langchain`, `torch`, and `transformers`.
3.  **Initializes Llama 2 Model and Tokenizer**: Loads the Llama 2 model and tokenizer, configuring quantization for efficient memory usage.
4.  **Creates Hugging Face Pipeline**: Creates a `text-generation` pipeline using the loaded Llama 2 model and tokenizer.
5.  **Data Ingestion**: Loads data from a text file (`MPRA_paper_112394.txt`) using `TextLoader`.
6.  **Splits Text into Chunks**: Splits the loaded text into smaller chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
7.  **Generates Embeddings**: Creates embeddings for the text chunks using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` with a Sentence Transformer model.
8.  **Stores Embeddings in ChromaDB**: Initializes ChromaDB, stores the text chunk embeddings, and persists the database locally.
9.  **Retrieval and Question Answering**: Sets up a retrieval chain using ChromaDB and the Llama 2 model to answer questions based on the ingested data.
